## How to Contribute to Guidelines and Templates via Pull Request (PR)

To propose fixes, improvements, or new content for the `.tex` files in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**
	- If you have write access, clone directly:
	  ```
	  git clone <repository-url>
	  cd ThesisWork
	  ```

2. **Create a New Branch**
	- Always create a new branch for your changes:
	  ```
	  git checkout -b your-feature-or-fix-branch
	  ```

3. **Edit the `.tex` Files**
	- Open the relevant `.tex` files (e.g., `HowToThesis/notes.tex`).
	- Make corrections, add new content, or propose ideas.
    - Smaller changes are easier to review (you can do multiple).

4. **Commit Your Changes**
	- Stage and commit your edits:
	  ```
	  git add HowToThesis/notes.tex
	  git commit -m "Describe your changes (e.g., fix typos, add section, propose idea)"
	  ```

5. **Push Your Branch**
	- Push your branch to the remote repository:
	  ```
	  git push origin your-feature-or-fix-branch
	  ```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
	- Go to the repository on GitHub.
	- Click "Compare & pull request" for your branch.
	- Fill in the PR description, explaining what you changed and why.
	- Submit the PR.

7. **Review and Respond**
	- Collaborate with maintainers if they request changes or feedback.
	- Update your branch as needed and push again; the PR will update automatically.

**Best Practices:**
 - Make focused, clear commits.
 - Use descriptive branch and PR names.
 - Reference issues if relevant.
 - For new ideas, add comments in `.tex` files or explain in the PR.

This workflow helps maintainers review and merge your improvements efficiently.
