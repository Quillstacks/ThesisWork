\section*{Instructions for Writing a Research Proposal}

\marginnote{\newthought{These submissions are not an end in themselves}, but rather a means to an end. They serve as a scaffold for your thesis work, giving you a helpful yet decisive nudge to structure.}

\newthought{Write an introduction and motivation} that briefly presents the research topic, explains its significance, 
and clearly providing the context for your thesis work. Half a page to one page should suffice.

\newthought{Write your problem statement} by reviewing the literature, current work and identify and pinpoint any gaps or 
unresolved issues or open questions that remain or emerge from the current state of the art.

\newthought{State your research objectives or questions.} Explain the expected outcomes and discuss what you hope to find or achieve 
and the potential impact of your contributions.

\newthought{Provide a realistic timeline} for completing each stage of your thesis work.

\newthought{Follow this template, its structure and format}, ensure your proposal is logically structured, and proofread your work before submission. 
Keep your page count below 4 pages. It might be obvious, but worth mentioning, 
that this submission can be repurposed as part of your first chapter of your thesis later on.
