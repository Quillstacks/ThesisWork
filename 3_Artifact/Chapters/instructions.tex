\section*{Instructions for Getting Submission Ready}

\marginnote{\newthought{These submissions are not an end in themselves}, but rather a means to an end. At this point it will help you to finalize and polish your thesis work.}


\marginnote{\newthought{The checklists are not bureaucratic hurdles}, but deliberate tools to help you ensure that your thesis reflects 
strong academic practice, clarity, and methodological rigor. 
They are designed to make the final refinement of your work systematic rather than last-minute guesswork.}

\newthought{Before submitting your final thesis, work through each checklist carefully.} 
These checklists cover core aspects of responsible and high-quality research: structure and formatting, methodological transparency, 
reproducibility, ethical considerations, and scholarly writing standards. Their purpose is to help you verify that your thesis meets the 
expectations of academic work in this program.
