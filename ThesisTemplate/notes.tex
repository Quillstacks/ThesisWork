% Introduction
\makeintroduction{
  We have all been there - facing that empty stack of papers or pixels for that matter, ultimately facing the daunting task of writing a scientific thesis.
  \newthought{This template} tries to bypass some of that empty paper anxiety by providing some intertia to get you going. 
  Feel free to clone and adapt it to your needs. If you come across parts which you adapt, and think should be adapted in the template in general, 

  \newthought{Please Contribute back - } This project is open for contributions, 
  via \href{https://github.com/Quillstacks/ThesisWork/tree/952300e7be221eb82c4f1b615db7cd3ace1ce774/ThesisTemplate}{GitHub} to report issues and suggest improvements and changes, submit a pull requests.


  \newthought{While this template} provides implicit guidance on structure, format and style, it is not a substitute 
  for reading the companion guide.

  \newthought{This document is a living work and should not be considered complete}—there are approaches I have tested and refined, 
  others I am still exploring, some I will adapt based on new insights, and perspectives I thought I understood but continue to evolve.
  That being said, in a near future this space will be ..

  \vfill
  \newthought{Your Abstract.} The abstract provides a concise summary of your thesis, including the research question, 
  chosen approach, key findings, and their interpretation. 
  It should be no longer than half a page. While optional, feel free to write the abstract in English 
  and the native language of your institution.
  The abstract is best written after the main sections are complete, 
  ensuring it accurately reflects the content and contributions of your work. This is probably the only part of your thesis that will be read by everyone,
  so make it count - and make the reader understand why to read on.

  \makeacknowledgment{%
  \newthought{You will want to thank} your supervisor(s), your industry partners and institute, colleagues, friends, family and anyone else who supported 
  you during your journey. If you want to get personal and lyric, this is the place in your thesis to do so. 
  \newthought{For my part,} I want to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have and will have contributed to the development and refinement of this thesis template.
  \newthought{And I want to thank my wife,} for putting up with me stealing weekends and evenings in exchange for this template.

\newthought{Appendix 1}
\label{app:1}
and a short description of appendix 1. This description is between 2-3 sentences long. The main text must reference the appendix where appropriate.
\newthought{Appendix 2}
\label{app:2}
contains tables, data, questionnaires, proofs, derivations, and other ancillary information that might 
otherwise negatively affect the flow of the main text.


\vfill
\newthought{The appendix} 
is not a dumping ground for material that does not fit into the main text due to page limitations.
Appendices are optional, include an appendix only when necessary. Often enough you do not need it.
