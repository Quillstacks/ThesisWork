% Introduction
\makeintroduction{%
  \newthought{You have only little time} to write your thesis, and do the development and research needed.
  Alongside there is some bureaucracy and paperwork to handle.

  \newthought{This roadmap} aims to simplify the process by providing a clear roadmap, points of contact, and anything else you ought to know. 
  Outlining the thesis process from eligibility to defense. 
  Think of this as a hub, with spokes leading to more detailed resources.

  
  \newthought{Feedback is invaluable} in this process. Names, links, processes, and requirements may change over time.
  If you have suggestions, corrections, or additional tips, please contribute back. 
  This helps keep the roadmap accurate and useful for everyone - as many did before you, pay it forward.
